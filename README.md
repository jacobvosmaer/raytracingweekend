# Ray Tracing in a Weekend

Following along with the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) book.

The book gives step by step instructions to write a ray tracer in C++. In this repo I follow the steps but I am using C instead of C++. The output of the program is a [PPM image file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm).

```
make
./main > image.ppm
```

For more information about this repository, see the [blog post](https://blog.jacobvosmaer.nl/0022-ray-tracing-weekend/) where I talk about what I did here.
